# Self_Driving_Car_Project

This project was a part of the ELEC-C9820 course: Electronics and design workshop. Our group decided to do something different compared to other groups in the course. While most others worked on visitor tracking for the Helsinki Design Week, we decided to design and build a Self-Driving Car. The main goal of our project was to learn about electronics and new software like OpenCV and go deeper into the subject.
